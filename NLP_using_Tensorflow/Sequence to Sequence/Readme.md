Sequence to Sequence Natural language processing with Attention using beam search. We also look for BLEU Score.

The model can be used for Language translation, Question Answer query, Human machine interaction.

The following diagram shows an overview of the model. At each time-step the decoder's output is combined with a weighted sum over the encoded input, to predict the next word.
