# Natural-language-processing

We perform Natural Language task using different APIs and algorithm. 

1) Natural Language Processing task using tensorflow API to tarin model from scratch using transformer and RNN architecture. 
 Some of the task include:
 Sequence to Sequence, Part of Speech, Named-entity recognition, Text Similarity, Text generation, Sentiment Analysis, Mask Filling
 
2) Fine tuning pretrained model for Natural Language Processing task using Huggingface and Haysatck API.

3)NLP task using sklearn library.
